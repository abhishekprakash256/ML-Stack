## Recommendation system 
Using the past behavior to recommend new system, or use the similarity of the data to predict. The system has multiple models and system, it's complication - the stages are as follows - retrieval, ranking, post-ranking.

- The recommendation system has multiple stages
- tricky to train 
- optimize is problem 
- evaluation is tough as well, not supervised learning 
- Tricky to deploy 
- most of the model have multiple stages 
- Tensorflow recommended can be used 
- it covers all the process from reocmmndation to evaluation, embedding 
- Tensorflow ranking can be used for recommendation as per need


### Approaches to this problem
- content based filtering , process the data from the based on content that belong to categories.
- Collaborative filtering system used as a suggestion for the system to collaborate with object types and the users choices 
- we do embedding to find the interest in the user and the value 
- dims can be added and embedding is used for the recommendation system
- matrix factorization is also used
- SGD is used to optimze the loss function
