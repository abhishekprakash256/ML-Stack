### What is machine learning ?

### The machine learning diagram

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves
with experience E.

### Use of the machine learning 

 First you would look at what spam typically looks like. You might notice that
some words or phrases (such as “4U,” “credit card,” “free,” and “amazing”) tend to
come up a lot in the subject. Perhaps you would also notice a few other patterns
in the sender’s name, the email’s body, and so on.

#### Data mining 

Applying ML techniques to dig into large amounts of data can help discover patterns
that were not immediately apparent. This is called data mining.

### Machine learning is good for

- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of
  rules: one Machine Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better.
- Complex problems for which there is no good solution at all using a traditional
  approach: the best Machine Learning techniques can find a solution.
- Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
-  Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data

### Types of Machine learning

- Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsuper‐
  vised, semisupervised, and Reinforcement Learning)
- Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch
  learning)
-  Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points,
  or instead detect patterns in the training data and build a predictive model, much
  like scientists do (instance-based versus model-based learning)
