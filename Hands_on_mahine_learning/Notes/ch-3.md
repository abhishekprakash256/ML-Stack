### Classification problems 
The use of A Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier, using Scikit-Learn’s SGDClassifier class. This clas‐
sifier has the advantage of being capable of handling very large datasets.

### Evaluation of the model 
Use of the cross validation is done with k folds. A much better way to evaluate the performance of a classifier is to look at the confusion matrix. The general idea is to count the number of times instances of class A are classified as class B.
